# prepare4MFA
Simple R package with a few functions to facilitate preparation of datasets for MFA.

This package started as "MultiDataManager"
When I realized that what I intended to do would be facilitated by having an expressionSet like class to simultaneously manage data, variable information and samples information I created the expressionSetDF package.

In the short term this package will contain only what is still useful from MultiDataManager
